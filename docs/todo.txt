- add registry of built in functions
- add concept of types somehow
- BCI.CALL needs a target

- Expand lexer
  - Source location information
  - Error reporting
- Expand parser
  - Source location information
  - Error reporting
- Create Bytecode Compilation
  - Simple bytecode compiler which does checking across the program
- Create VM
  - Takes bytecode and interperts (requires implementing all functions? stdlib?)
  - Build out CLI stuff here
- Create LLVM Backend
  - Takes bytecode and compiles


- Figure out what parallel map looks like
  - Would be nice to control concurrency? Or do we let that sit in a CLI arg?
  - @!> ?
  - If its a cli arg we could just have every map be parallel? (does that... work?)
  - This will complicate reduce (since we will have to "notify" the reducer when all the maps are done (maybe ok?)
